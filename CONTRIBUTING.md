### PRs, Issues, and Discussions

Pull Requests are always welcome - I will do my best to review them in a timely manner. I cannot promise your feature will always get accepted. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or discussion. My only real 'rule' is that you should write **unit tests** for the new features you add.

## Getting Started

- **Building**
  
  `pls` is made using `bashly`. To get started, you'll need to install `bashly`. Please refer to the [installation instructions on the `bashly` website](https://bashly.dannyb.co/installation/).

  You can run `bashly generate` to generate the new `pls` script containing your changes. You can then run `./pls` in the root of this repository to test your changes. `bashly generate -w` will watch for changes and regenerate the script automatically.

- **Testing** 

  `pls` also uses `shellspec` for unit tests. To run the tests, you'll need to install `shellspec`. Please refer to the [installation instructions in the `shellspec` repository](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

  You can then run `shellspec --shell bash --format documentation` to run the tests.

But hey, who are we kidding? Of course `pls` comes with a `pls` file of its own, so to build or test, you can just run `pls build` or `pls test`!
