  Project Level Shortcuts (pls) is a command-line tool designed to streamline 
  your workflow by allowing you to create, manage, and execute custom aliases 
  for frequently used commands.

  Key features:
   * Easy alias creation and modification
        Add, remove, rename, or change functionality of aliases with a simple
        CLI interface.
   * Project Level Specificity 
        Aliases can be defined at both project and global levels, with
        project-specific aliases taking precedence.
   * Intuitive command execution:
        Run a command associated with an alias using the 'pls' prefix.
        e.g. pls open, pls test, pls deploy
   * Easily shareable aliases:
        Streamline your team's workflow by sharing aliases across projects, or
        make setup of your product dead-easy for your users.
        Just add a pls.yml to the project's root directory, and you're off!
   * Editor Integration:
        Use your preferred text editor to create and modify complex commands.

environment_variables:
- name: pls_global
  help: |
    The path to the global .pls file.
    This file contains aliases that are available in all directories.
    Default is determined by '\$HOME/pls.yml'.  
  default: $HOME/pls.yml
- name: pls_file_name
  help: |
    The name of the file that contains the entries.
    It is not recommended to change this value for consistency sake, but you can if you feel the need to do so.
  default: pls.yml 
- name: pls_dir
  help: |
    The path to the directory used by pls for storing internal files, such as the command cache.
    It is not recommended to set this to a directory in /tmp/, as this may break caching.
    Default is determined by '\$HOME/.local/share/pls'.
    (For you, this points to '$HOME/.local/share/pls')
  default: $HOME/.local/share/pls
- name: pls_enable_safe_mode
  help: |
    Enable or disable safe mode. This turns off the verification warning that appears when you run an uncached command.
    This is not recommended, especially not on sensitive systems. Will not affect extra safe mode.
  default: "true"
- name: pls_enable_extra_safe_mode
  help: |
    Enables extra safe mode. This will prompt you to confirm every command before running it, even if it is cached.
    Does not assure that the command is safe, but it does give you a chance to review it.
  default: "false"
- name: pls_mock_root
  help: |
    For internal testing purposes only. This variable is used to mock the location of the root directory of the file system.
    Do not change this value unless you know what you are doing.
  default: ""
  private: true

        validate: not_empty
  - name: this_does_nothing
    help: |
