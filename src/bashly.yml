  Project Level Shortcuts (pls) is a command-line tool designed to streamline 
  your workflow by allowing you to create, manage, and execute custom aliases 
  for frequently used commands.

  Key features:
   * Easy alias creation and modification
        Add, remove, rename, or change functionality of aliases with a simple
        CLI interface.
   * Project Level Specificity 
        Aliases can be defined at both project and global levels, with
        project-specific aliases taking precedence.
   * Intuitive command execution:
        Run a command associated with an alias using the 'pls' prefix.
        e.g. pls open, pls test, pls deploy
   * Easily shareable aliases:
        Streamline your team's workflow by sharing aliases across projects, or
        make setup of your product dead-easy for your users.
        Just add a pls file to the project's root directory, and you're off!
