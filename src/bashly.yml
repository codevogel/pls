  Project Level Shortcuts (pls) is a command-line tool designed to streamline 
  your workflow by allowing you to create, manage, and execute custom aliases 
  for frequently used commands.

  Key features:
   * Easy alias creation and modification
        Add, remove, rename, or change functionality of aliases with a simple
        CLI interface.
   * Project Level Specificity 
        Aliases can be defined at both project and global levels, with
        project-specific aliases taking precedence.
   * Intuitive command execution:
        Run a command associated with an alias using the 'pls' prefix.
        e.g. pls open, pls test, pls deploy
   * Easily shareable aliases:
        Streamline your team's workflow by sharing aliases across projects, or
        make setup of your product dead-easy for your users.
        Just add a pls file to the project's root directory, and you're off!

  To see examples of how to use pls, run 'pls <command> --help'
environment_variables:
- name: pls_filename
  help: |
    The name of the data file in which your aliases live. It is not recommended to change this value for consistency sake, but you can if you feel the need to do so.
  default: .pls.yml
- name: pls_global
  help: |
    The path to the global pls file (contains aliases that are available in all directories). Default is determined by '\$HOME/\$PLS_FILENAME'.
  default: $(echo $HOME/$PLS_FILENAME)
- name: pls_dir
  help: |
    The path to the directory used by pls for storing internal files, such as the command cache. It is not recommended to set this to a directory in /tmp/, as this may break caching across reboots. Default is determined by '\$HOME/.local/share/pls'.
  default: $(echo $HOME/.local/share/pls)
- name: pls_enable_cache_check
  help: |
    Enable or disable cache checking, which prevents you from unexpectedly running the wrong command. Setting this to false turns off the verification warning that appears when you run an uncached command.
    This is not recommended, especially not on sensitive systems. This setting is overridden by 'pls_always_cache_check'.
  default: "true"
- name: pls_always_verify
  help: |
    This will always prompt you to confirm every command before running it, even if it is already cached. Does not assure that the command is safe, but does give you a chance to review it. This setting overrides 'pls_enable_cache_check'.
  default: "false"
- name: pls_enable_fzf
  help: |
    Enable or disable the use of fzf for interactive selection. Note that this is only relevant for the 'pick_alias' command. If fzf is not installed, this will have no effect.
  default: "true"
